 # A new animal: Bears!
 
 Zoe says your program is really helping her keep track of the tigers! As a result, Zoe has been promoted at the zoo. She's now in charge of tigers and bears, which means your program now needs to describe bear behaviors as well!
 
 Create a class called `Bear`, which should be very similar to your `Tiger` class. The `Bear` class should also have `name` and `favoriteFood` instance variables, because bears have names and favorite foods, just like tigers. The initializer method should take one argument, `name`, and set the `name` instance variable to its given value, and `favoriteFood` to `"fish"`.  The `eat` method for the Bear class should also be exactly the same as in the Tiger class.  However, bears sleep very differently than tigers, so the sleep method for the `Bear` class should instead print `"<name> hibernates for 4 months"` instead to reflect the difference in their sleeping behavior.
 
 Finally, create `Tiger` and `Bear` objects, and then call their `eat` method to test its behavior.

class Tiger {
    // copy your Tiger class from the previous section!
}

class Bear {
    // complete the Bear class here!

 ## Testing
 
 When you're done, uncomment the below lines of code, and it should compile and output the following:
 
     Tigger eats meat
     YUM!!! Tigger wants more meat
     Pooh eats fish
     YUM!!! Pooh wants more fish
     Pooh eats meat
     Pooh hibernates for 4 months
 
 */

//let tiger = Tiger(name: "Tigger")
//tiger.eat("meat")
//let bear = Bear(name: "Pooh")
//bear.eat("fish")
//bear.eat("meat")
