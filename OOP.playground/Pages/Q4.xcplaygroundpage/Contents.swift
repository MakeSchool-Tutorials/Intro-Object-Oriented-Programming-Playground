 Zoe says your program is really helping her keep track of the tigers! As a result, Zoe has been promoted at the zoo. She's now in charge of tigers and bears, which means your program now needs to describe bear behaviors as well!
 
 Create a class called `Bear`, which should be very similar to your `Tiger` class. The `Bear` class should also have `name` and `favoriteFood` instance variables, because bears have names and favorite foods, just like tigers. The initializer method should take one argument, `name`, and set the `name` instance variable to its given value, and `favoriteFood` to `"fish"`.  The `eat` method for the Bear class should also be exactly the same as in the Tiger class.  However, bears sleep very differently than tigers, so the sleep method for the `Bear` class should instead print `"<name> hibernates for 4 months"` instead to reflect the difference in their sleeping behavior.
 
 Finally, create `Tiger` and `Bear` objects, and then call their `eat` method to test its behavior.
