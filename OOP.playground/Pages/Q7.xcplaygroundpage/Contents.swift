 Zoe went in to pet the bees on her lunch break and nobody has seen her since! The animals haven't been fed, and they're getting hungry. Let's make your program more useful so that it can help any zookeeper keep track of all the animals they feed each day.
 
 Create a `Zookeeper` class that contains a `name` instance variable and an initializer method that sets `name` using an argument. A zookeeper needs to feed many animals each day, so let's add a `feedAnimals` method, which should take two arguments: `animals` – an array of `Animal`s, and `food` – a string. This method should first print `"<name> is feeding <food> to <animals.length> animals"`, then iterate over the array of animals and call each animal's `eat` method, passing the value of `food` as the argument.
 
 Finally, call this `feedAnimals` method, using an array containing an instance of each animal, and your own favorite food.
