 # Object-Oriented Programming: An Introduction
 
 In this tutorial, we're going to learn about _Object-Oriented Programming_ in Swift. What is that? It's a _programming paradigm_ based on the concept of "objects" – things that contain data, and methods that performn operations on those data.
 
 That sounds pretty vague. But worry not! We will start what we already know in Swift – namely, functions, variables, etc. – and build our object-oriented program from there.
 
 First, write a function named sleep that takes an argument name. This function should print "`<name> sleeps for 8 hours`" each time it's called. Be sure to print this exact format.
 
 For example, this function call:
    
    sleep("Tigger")
 
 should print this output exactly:

    Tigger sleeps for 8 hours
 
 To check your code, you can bring up the console by pressing ⇧⌘Y. Your output should get printed there!
*/

// Complete the sleep function below
func sleep(name: String) {
    
}
sleep("Tigger")

/*:
 When you're done, copy the contents of your completed sleep function, so we can bring it over to the next section.
